## Worker isolation

Workers ran under `best-effort-v1` with isolation status `not-certified`. Research, source-support and review workers run as independent CLI processes with explicit role inputs and the available restrictions. Complete tool absence and context, file and network isolation are not guaranteed; use trusted projects and operator-approved inputs.

## Part A

- Harness result: verified
- Goal result: met by the verified build
- Status: verified
- Outside dependencies: none
- Confirmed answers: `{"event_without_agent": false, "every_time": "usually", "external_system": "none", "irreversible": false, "job": "procedure", "must_survive_compromise": "not-required", "own_context": false, "side_effects": false, "trigger": "model", "who_disables": "contributor"}`
- Goal verdict: met (plan_skill writes .agents/skills/<name>/ and, for a Claude Code target, the relative .claude/skills/<name> link. It builds only from a confirmed part with the accepted revision, refuses conflicts unless the user agrees, sets the status only to built and bundles no scripts. All five accepted requirements hold. The recommended outside controls are precautions; the README marks them recommended and not verified.)

| `skills.body.gotchas-first` | warning | judged | pass | 'Rules that are easy to get wrong' comes right after the short intro and before the Procedure, in SKILL.md rather than in a reference file. | skills/build-skill/SKILL.md:19-45 | docs/best-practices/skills.md#3-keep-skillmd-lean-and-put-gotchas-first, https://agentskills.io/skill-creation/best-practices.md |

| `skills.body.reasons-before-hard-rules` | warning | judged | pass | The rules carry reasons, for example placeholders 'only Claude Code processes them ... Codex leaves them as literal text'.

| `skills.body.strictness-matches-fragility` | warning | judged | pass | The body is strict only on fragile points: bindings, overwrite and placeholders.

## Part B

- Harness result: verified
- Goal result: met by the verified build
- Status: verified
- Outside dependencies: none
- Confirmed answers: `{"event_without_agent": false, "every_time": "usually", "external_system": "none", "irreversible": false, "job": "procedure", "must_survive_compromise": "not-required", "own_context": false, "side_effects": false, "trigger": "model", "who_disables": "contributor"}`
- Goal verdict: met (The skill takes the recommendation from forge.py select, asks one question per message without leading wording, keeps findings and records as data until the user confirms them, and records decisions and README outside controls only after explicit confirmation. All five accepted requirements hold.)

## Part C

- Harness result: verified
- Goal result: met by the verified build
- Status: verified
- Outside dependencies: none
- Confirmed answers: `{"event_without_agent": false, "every_time": "usually", "external_system": "cli", "irreversible": false, "job": "procedure", "must_survive_compromise": "not-required", "own_context": false, "side_effects": false, "trigger": "model", "who_disables": "contributor"}`
- Goal verdict: met (Forge fetches each source itself and checks the quote verbatim. A separate support worker judges each finding, and responses are schema-validated. Research is bound to its brief, only requirements the user accepted or edited enter the hashed revision, fetched content is marked untrusted, and issues are filed only by the user.

Contested `skills.body.reasons-before-hard-rules`:

Contested `skills.description.voice`:
- Always write in the third person; an inconsistent point of view can cause discovery problems (https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices)

## Part D

- Harness result: verified
- Goal result: met by the verified build
- Status: verified
- Outside dependencies: none
- Confirmed answers: `{"event_without_agent": false, "every_time": "usually", "external_system": "none", "irreversible": false, "job": "procedure", "must_survive_compromise": "not-required", "own_context": false, "side_effects": false, "trigger": "model", "who_disables": "contributor"}`
- Goal verdict: met (Scripts decide script rules first, and a fresh review worker judges the rest with a reason and citation for each verdict. Not-run cases never count as passes, Codex inventory gaps are stated as best-effort, error-rule exclusions need the user's confirmation, and checked files are treated as data. The skill writes the contract-bound report. All six accepted requirements hold.)

Contested `skills.body.reasons-before-hard-rules`:
- All-caps ALWAYS or NEVER is a yellow flag; explain the reasoning instead (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anthropics/skills/main/skills/skill-creator/SKILL.md, https://agentskills.io/skill-creation/evaluating-skills.md)
- Discipline skills need firm prohibitions and rationalization tables (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/obra/superpowers/main/skills/writing-skills/SKILL.md, https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices)

Contested `skills.description.voice`:
- Always write in the third person; an inconsistent point of view can cause discovery problems (https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices)
- Use imperative "Use this skill when" phrasing for the trigger (https://agentskills.io/skill-creation/optimizing-descriptions.md, https://raw.githubusercontent.com/obra/superpowers/main/skills/writing-skills/SKILL.md)
